## Expanding Horizons

Today marks a significant milestone for ArceApps. We are rolling out full internationalization (i18n) support, making the portfolio accessible to a broader audience.

The goal is to support English as the default language while providing a seamless experience for Spanish-speaking users.

### Key Features

1.  **Auto-detection**: The site automatically detects the user's browser language.
2.  **Content Separation**: Blog posts and devlogs are now organized by language.
3.  **UI Translation**: All interface elements are translated.
