In 2020, mentoring a Junior Developer often meant explaining how `RecyclerView` adapters work or debugging a NullPointerException together.

In 2026, with tools like **GitHub Copilot** and **Cursor**, juniors can generate functional code in seconds. They don't need you to be a syntax dictionary anymore. So, what is the role of a Senior Mentor today?

## Shift from "How" to "Why"

The AI can answer "How do I implement a sorting algorithm?". It struggles with "Why should we use this sorting algorithm over that one given our memory constraints?".

As a mentor, your value has shifted up the abstraction stack. Instead of reviewing syntax, review intent.

### The Socratic Method

When a mentee comes to you with a problem, don't give the solution. Ask:
*   "What have you tried so far?"
*   "What does the AI suggest, and why do you think it might be wrong?"
*   "What are the trade-offs of this approach?"

This teaches **Critical Thinking**, which is the one skill AI cannot replace.

## Debugging the Thought Process

AI-generated code often "looks right" but fails in edge cases. Juniors might trust the output blindly.
Your job is to teach them to be **skeptical**.

*   **Code Review Sessions:** Don't just comment on PRs. Sit down (or share screen) and walk through the logic. Ask, "What happens if this network call fails?" or "How does this handle orientation changes?".
*   **Testing Mindset:** Teach them to write tests *before* or *with* the AI code to verify behavior, not just implementation.

## Psychological Safety

In an era of rapid change, juniors feel immense pressure to "know everything". A good mentor creates a safe space where saying "I don't understand this generated code" is celebrated, not punished.

Remind them: **You are not your code.** Bugs happen. The goal is learning.

## Conclusion

Mentorship is no longer about transferring knowledge; it's about transferring **wisdom**. It's about teaching the patterns, the pitfalls, and the architectural principles that govern robust software.
