The Android development cycle never stops. While we are still adapting to Android 15, Google is already paving the way for the next major version: **Android 16**. And keeping with the dessert tradition (internally at least), the code name is **Baklava**.

## 📅 The New Roadmap

Google has surprised us by accelerating the release cycle.
*   **Q2 2025**: First Developer Previews.
*   **Q3 2025**: Platform Stability.
*   **Q4 2025**: Final Release.

This shift aims to align Android releases closer to hardware launches (Pixel devices) and ensure OEMs have more time to adapt.

## 🍰 What to Expect from 'Baklava'

While it's early for definitive features, the leaks and AOSP commits point to several key areas:

### 1. Desktop Mode Revamp
Android has had a hidden desktop mode for years. Android 16 seems to be the version where this becomes a user-facing feature, competing directly with Samsung DeX. Expect better window management and multi-monitor support.

### 2. Lock Screen Widgets Return
Inspired by iOS (and looking back at Android 4.2), widgets on the lock screen are making a comeback. But this time, they are built with **Jetpack Glance**, ensuring they are battery-efficient and secure.

### 3. AI Core Integration
Android 16 will likely bake **Gemini Nano** deeper into the OS. We expect new APIs for "System Intents" that allow apps to hand off complex tasks to the on-device AI model without needing cloud access.

## 🛠️ Preparing Your Apps

As developers, what should we do?
1.  **Edge-to-Edge by Default**: If you haven't adopted it yet, Android 16 might enforce it strictly.
2.  **Predictive Back**: Ensure your app supports the predictive back gesture animation, as it will be standard.
3.  **Scoped Storage**: Restrictions on file access will likely get tighter. Move to Photo Picker if you haven't already.

Android 16 'Baklava' promises to be a refined, polished release that cements the AI-first future of the platform.
